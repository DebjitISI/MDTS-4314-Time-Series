plot(co2)#as seasonal fluctuation is constant so the factors trend and seasonal are dependent
#model of co2 is a additive model :T_t+S_t+I_t
plot(AirPassengers)# as seasonal fluctuation is intensified so the trend and seasonal are inter dependent
#model of airpassengers is a multiplicative model :T_t*S_t*I_t
